I did my best. I got the website displaying the information correctly
and I'm happy about that. I'm more of an artistic person, so I'm
confident I did well on the front end portion of the assignment. 
To use the site:

1. run server with node app.js
2. run portfoliosite.html on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/portfoliosite.html)
3. input any desired information (for piece URL, put johnsucksatcode.jpg)
4. submit, and you will be redirected to a page with your input info at the bottom

Thanks for the help last Monday, I gave this assignment as much time
as I could, but I had 3 different semester-long assignments all due towards the end of
April (one of which involved organizing an annual Peoria-wide event) and I couldn't
allocate as much time as I wanted to with this assignment.
